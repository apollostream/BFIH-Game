  "report": "# BFIH Analysis Report: Do vaccines cause autism in children?\n\n**Analysis conducted using Bayesian Framework for Intellectual Honesty (BFIH)**\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n**Verdict:** REJECTED\n\nThe Bayesian analysis under the privileged scientific\u2010consensus paradigm (K0) overwhelmingly favors H2 (\u201cNo causal link exists\u201d) with a posterior probability of 0.6765. The runner\u2010up is H0 (\u201cOther unexplained factor\u201d) at 0.3152. All direct\u2010cause or partial\u2010link hypotheses (H1, H3\u2013H5) receive negligible support (combined posterior \u2248 0.0083).\n\nUnder K0, H2 is the clear winner. In contrast, the vaccine\u2010skeptic paradigm (K1) places highest posterior on H0 (0.4687) and H1 (0.3579), while the precautionary paradigm (K2) also favors H0 (0.5065) followed by H2 (0.4205). These differences reflect deep prior biases in K1 and K2, but do not alter the robust K0 conclusion.\n\nKey drivers include large\u2010scale epidemiological studies and meta\u2010analyses consistently showing no increased autism risk after vaccination (high likelihood ratios against H1), well\u2010characterized timelines in which autism symptoms emerge independently of immunization, and a lack of plausible biological mechanisms linking vaccine components to neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nThe rejection of a causal link is robust within the scientific\u2010consensus framework but remains paradigm\u2010dependent. Paradigms emphasizing institutional distrust or precaution assign more weight to unknown or subgroup\u2010risk hypotheses. Nonetheless, even under these views, direct causation (H1) never achieves majority support, reinforcing the overall conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Paradigms Analyzed\n\n### K0: Scientific Consensus\n\n*(No explicit stance data available)*\n\nThis paradigm reflects the mainstream view of epidemiologists, immunologists, and child\u2010development specialists. It assumes high credibility of large\u2010scale trials, laboratory studies, and regulatory oversight.\n\n### K1: Vaccine Skeptic\n\n*(No explicit stance data available)*\n\nThis perspective gives greater weight to anecdotal reports, case series, and distrust of pharmaceutical and regulatory bodies. It treats official safety assurances with caution.\n\n### K2: Precautionary\n\n*(No explicit stance data available)*\n\nThis viewpoint accepts the bulk of vaccine science but remains alert to potential long\u2010term, rare, or subgroup\u2010specific risks. It emphasizes ongoing vigilance and targeted research.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Hypothesis Set\n\n**H0: OTHER \u2013 Unforeseen explanation**  \nThis hypothesis posits that neither vaccines nor known confounders fully account for the observed timing of autism diagnosis. It allows for an as\u2010yet unidentified environmental, genetic, or methodological factor driving the apparent vaccine\u2013autism relationship. Under H0, further research could reveal new etiologies or diagnostic biases.  \n**Prior Probabilities:**\n\n| Paradigm | Prior P(H0) | Rationale                                     |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| K0 (Scientific Consensus)       | 0.05        | Science leaves small room for unknown factors |\n| K1 (Vaccine Skeptic)       | 0.10        | Skeptics allow for hidden mechanisms          |\n| K2 (Precautionary)       | 0.10        | Precautionary view admits unknowns            |\n\n**H1: TRUE \u2013 Vaccines directly cause autism**  \nH1 asserts a direct causal link, via components such as thimerosal, aluminium adjuvants, or antigens, triggering neurotoxicity or immune\u2010mediated damage. It suggests a biological mechanism by which vaccination initiates or accelerates autism pathology. This view underpins many high\u2010profile anecdotal claims and contested studies.  \n**Prior Probabilities:**\n\n| Paradigm | Prior P(H1) | Rationale                                                    |\n|----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| K0 (Scientific Consensus)       | 0.05        | Consensus science finds no credible mechanism or effect      |\n| K1 (Vaccine Skeptic)       | 0.35        | Skeptics give substantial weight to anecdotal and case reports |\n| K2 (Precautionary)       | 0.10        | Acknowledges low\u2010probability harms but lacks strong evidence |\n\n**H2: FALSE \u2013 No causal link exists**  \nH2 holds that the temporal overlap of vaccination schedules and autism onset is coincidental. It relies on extensive epidemiological data and meta\u2010analyses showing no increased autism risk post\u2010vaccination. Mechanistic biology does not support vaccine\u2010induced neurodevelopmental harm.  \n**Prior Probabilities:**\n\n| Paradigm | Prior P(H2) | Rationale                                                      |\n|----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| K0 (Scientific Consensus)       | 0.60        | Strong empirical support from large, well\u2010controlled studies   |\n| K1 (Vaccine Skeptic)       | 0.10        | Skeptics remain unconvinced by mainstream epidemiology         |\n| K2 (Precautionary)       | 0.30        | Precautionaries accept global safety data but note limits      |\n\n**H3: PARTIAL \u2013 Rare subgroup vulnerability**  \nUnder H3, vaccines are innocuous for most children but may trigger autism\u2010like effects in a small genetically or immunologically predisposed subgroup. The subgroup is too small for detection in broad population studies yet could explain isolated case reports.  \n**Prior Probabilities:**\n\n| Paradigm | Prior P(H3) | Rationale                                              |\n|----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| K0 (Scientific Consensus)       | 0.10        | Minimal subgroup risk deemed remote by consensus       |\n| K1 (Vaccine Skeptic)       | 0.20        | Skeptics highlight possible rare adverse reactions     |\n| K2 (Precautionary)       | 0.20        | Precautionaries emphasize vulnerable subpopulations    |\n\n**H4: PARTIAL \u2013 Indirect pathway via immune activation**  \nH4 proposes that vaccine\u2010induced immune activation interacts with pre\u2010existing conditions (e.g., neuroinflammation) to subtly influence neurodevelopment. The effect is not a direct toxin but an indirect immunological cascade with rare neuropsychiatric outcomes.  \n**Prior Probabilities:**\n\n| Paradigm | Prior P(H4) | Rationale                                                  |\n|----------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| K0 (Scientific Consensus)       | 0.10        | Limited biological plausibility accepted only in edge cases |\n| K1 (Vaccine Skeptic)       | 0.15        | Skeptics consider immune pathways plausible explanations   |\n| K2 (Precautionary)       | 0.15        | Precautionary stance finds indirect pathways worth study   |\n\n**H5: PARTIAL \u2013 Timing/schedule effects only**  \nThis hypothesis holds that although individual vaccines are safe, the cumulative immune challenge of the recommended schedule may overwhelm some children\u2019s developing systems, potentially contributing to developmental issues. It focuses on timing rather than any specific vaccine component.  \n**Prior Probabilities:**\n\n| Paradigm | Prior P(H5) | Rationale                                                     |\n|----------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| K0 (Scientific Consensus)       | 0.10        | Consensus sees no overload effect in standard pediatric schedules |\n| K1 (Vaccine Skeptic)       | 0.10        | Skeptics argue schedule density is under\u2010researched           |\n| K2 (Precautionary)       | 0.15        | Precautionaries often question cumulative dosing impacts      |\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Clusters\n\n### Cluster: C1\n\n**Description:** High-quality cohort, case-control, and meta-analysis studies (large N, rigorous peer-review) consistently report no association between vaccines (MMR, thimerosal, antigen load) and autism.  \n**Evidence Items:** E1, E3, E4, E6, E9, E10, E14, E17, E18, E19, E20, E24, E26, E27, E29, E30, E31, E32, E37, E41, E43, E44, E45, E46\n\n  \n| Hypothesis | P(E\\|H) | P(E\\|\u00acH) | LR | WoE (dB) | Direction |\n|------------|--------|---------|-----|----------|-----------|\n| H0 (OTHER - Unforeseen explanation) | 0.7 | 0.6132 | 1.1416 | 0.58 | Weak Support |\n| H1 (TRUE - Vaccines directly ca...) | 0.05 | 0.6474 | 0.0772 | -11.12 | Strong Refutation |\n| H2 (FALSE - No causal link exists) | 0.9 | 0.1938 | 4.6452 | 6.67 | Moderate Support |\n| H3 (PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vul...) | 0.2 | 0.6639 | 0.3013 | -5.21 | Moderate Refutation |\n| H4 (PARTIAL - Indirect pathway ...) | 0.1 | 0.675 | 0.1481 | -8.29 | Moderate Refutation |\n| H5 (PARTIAL - Timing/schedule e...) | 0.1 | 0.675 | 0.1481 | -8.29 | Moderate Refutation |\n\nIn C1, H2 is moderately supported by the evidence (LR = 4.6452, WoE = 6.67 dB), H0 receives weak support (LR = 1.1416, WoE = 0.58 dB), while H1 is strongly refuted (LR = 0.0772, WoE = \u201311.12 dB) and H3\u2013H5 are moderately refuted. The WoE values show that high-quality epidemiological studies are substantially more likely under H2 than under competing hypotheses, and barely more likely under H0, whereas they are far less likely under H1, H3, H4, and H5.\n\n### Cluster: C2\n\n**Description:** Statements and reviews by IOM, CDC, WHO, AAP and other authoritative bodies concluding vaccines are not causally linked to autism.  \n**Evidence Items:** E2, E8, E11, E12, E13, E21, E25, E33, E34, E35, E36, E42, E49, E50\n\n  \n| Hypothesis | P(E\\|H) | P(E\\|\u00acH) | LR | WoE (dB) | Direction |\n|------------|--------|---------|-----|----------|-----------|\n| H0 (OTHER - Unforeseen explanation) | 0.75 | 0.6079 | 1.2338 | 0.91 | Weak Support |\n| H1 (TRUE - Vaccines directly ca...) | 0.05 | 0.6447 | 0.0776 | -11.1 | Strong Refutation |\n| H2 (FALSE - No causal link exists) | 0.9 | 0.1875 | 4.8 | 6.81 | Moderate Support |\n| H3 (PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vul...) | 0.15 | 0.6667 | 0.225 | -6.48 | Moderate Refutation |\n| H4 (PARTIAL - Indirect pathway ...) | 0.1 | 0.6722 | 0.1488 | -8.28 | Moderate Refutation |\n| H5 (PARTIAL - Timing/schedule e...) | 0.1 | 0.6722 | 0.1488 | -8.28 | Moderate Refutation |\n\nIn C2, authoritative reviews yield moderate support for H2 (LR = 4.8, WoE = 6.81 dB) and weak support for H0 (LR = 1.2338, WoE = 0.91 dB), while strongly refuting H1 (LR = 0.0776, WoE = \u201311.1 dB) and moderately refuting H3\u2013H5. This indicates that official bodies\u2019 conclusions are about 4.8 times more likely if H2 is true, add little evidence for H0, and heavily undermine H1.\n\n### Cluster: C3\n\n**Description:** Lower-quality or highly contested studies and policy signals suggesting vaccines (or schedule intensity) increase autism risk.  \n**Evidence Items:** E16, E22, E23, E39, E40, E47, E48, E51\n\n  \n| Hypothesis | P(E\\|H) | P(E\\|\u00acH) | LR | WoE (dB) | Direction |\n|------------|--------|---------|-----|----------|-----------|\n| H0 (OTHER - Unforeseen explanation) | 0.55 | 0.1842 | 2.9857 | 4.75 | Weak Support |\n| H1 (TRUE - Vaccines directly ca...) | 0.4 | 0.1921 | 2.0822 | 3.19 | Weak Support |\n| H2 (FALSE - No causal link exists) | 0.1 | 0.3563 | 0.2807 | -5.52 | Moderate Refutation |\n| H3 (PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vul...) | 0.3 | 0.1917 | 1.5652 | 1.95 | Weak Support |\n| H4 (PARTIAL - Indirect pathway ...) | 0.3 | 0.1917 | 1.5652 | 1.95 | Weak Support |\n| H5 (PARTIAL - Timing/schedule e...) | 0.35 | 0.1861 | 1.8806 | 2.74 | Weak Support |\n\nCluster C3\u2019s contested data weakly support H0 (LR = 2.9857, WoE = 4.75 dB), H1 (LR = 2.0822, WoE = 3.19 dB), H3 (LR = 1.5652, WoE = 1.95 dB), H4 (LR = 1.5652, WoE = 1.95 dB), and H5 (LR = 1.8806, WoE = 2.74 dB), while moderately refuting H2 (LR = 0.2807, WoE = \u20135.52 dB). The WoE values suggest these lower-quality signals slightly favor several hypotheses but undermine H2 and do not decisively support any single theory.\n\n### Cluster: C4\n\n**Description:** Documentation that key pro-link studies (e.g., Wakefield 1998) were retracted for fraud and ethics violations, undermining credibility of vaccine-autism claims.  \n**Evidence Items:** E7, E15, E38\n\n  \n| Hypothesis | P(E\\|H) | P(E\\|\u00acH) | LR | WoE (dB) | Direction |\n|------------|--------|---------|-----|----------|-----------|\n| H0 (OTHER - Unforeseen explanation) | 0.8 | 0.6053 | 1.3217 | 1.21 | Weak Support |\n| H1 (TRUE - Vaccines directly ca...) | 0.2 | 0.6368 | 0.314 | -5.03 | Moderate Refutation |\n| H2 (FALSE - No causal link exists) | 0.85 | 0.2625 | 3.2381 | 5.1 | Moderate Support |\n| H3 (PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vul...) | 0.25 | 0.6556 | 0.3814 | -4.19 | Weak Refutation |\n| H4 (PARTIAL - Indirect pathway ...) | 0.15 | 0.6667 | 0.225 | -6.48 | Moderate Refutation |\n| H5 (PARTIAL - Timing/schedule e...) | 0.15 | 0.6667 | 0.225 | -6.48 | Moderate Refutation |\n\nIn C4, retraction documentation moderately supports H2 (LR = 3.2381, WoE = 5.1 dB) and weakly supports H0 (LR = 1.3217, WoE = 1.21 dB), while moderately refuting H1 (LR = 0.314, WoE = \u20135.03 dB) and H4\u2013H5 (LR = 0.225, WoE = \u20136.48 dB), and weakly refuting H3 (LR = 0.3814, WoE = \u20134.19 dB). These metrics imply that evidence of scientific fraud significantly increases the likelihood of H2 relative to its negation and provides only minor backing for H0, while undermining hypotheses of a direct causal link.\n\n### Cluster: C5\n\n**Description:** Animal and translational work suggesting maternal immune activation can induce autism-like phenotypes, offering a non-vaccine mechanistic pathway.  \n**Evidence Items:** E5\n\n  \n| Hypothesis | P(E\\|H) | P(E\\|\u00acH) | LR | WoE (dB) | Direction |\n|------------|--------|---------|-----|----------|-----------|\n| H0 (OTHER - Unforeseen explanation) | 0.5 | 0.3789 | 1.3194 | 1.2 | Weak Support |\n| H1 (TRUE - Vaccines directly ca...) | 0.4 | 0.3842 | 1.0411 | 0.17 | Neutral |\n| H2 (FALSE - No causal link exists) | 0.3 | 0.5125 | 0.5854 | -2.33 | Weak Refutation |\n| H3 (PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vul...) | 0.4 | 0.3833 | 1.0435 | 0.18 | Neutral |\n| H4 (PARTIAL - Indirect pathway ...) | 0.8 | 0.3389 | 2.3607 | 3.73 | Weak Support |\n| H5 (PARTIAL - Timing/schedule e...) | 0.4 | 0.3833 | 1.0435 | 0.18 | Neutral |\n\nCluster C5\u2019s animal\u2010model evidence weakly supports H4 (LR = 2.3607, WoE = 3.73 dB) and H0 (LR = 1.3194, WoE = 1.2 dB), is neutral toward H1, H3, and H5 (LR\u22481, WoE\u22480 dB), and weakly refutes H2 (LR = 0.5854, WoE = \u20132.33 dB). This suggests that maternal immune activation models offer some support for H4, but do not strongly discriminate among most hypotheses and mildly challenge H2.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Joint Evidence Computation\n\n**Cumulative Evidence Effect (all clusters combined under K0):**\n\n  \n| Hypothesis | Prior | Joint P(E\\|H) | Joint P(E\\|\u00acH) | Total LR | Total WoE (dB) | Posterior |\n|------------|-------|--------------|---------------|----------|----------------|-----------|\n| H0 (OTHER - Unforeseen explanation) | 0.05 | 1.1550e-01 | 1.3204e-02 | 8.7472 | 9.42 | 0.315246 |\n| H1 (TRUE - Vaccines directly ca...) | 0.05 | 8.0000e-05 | 1.9279e-02 | 0.0041 | -23.82 | 0.000218 |\n| H2 (FALSE - No causal link exists) | 0.6 | 2.0655e-02 | 1.4815e-02 | 1.3942 | 1.44 | 0.676511 |\n| H3 (PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vul...) | 0.1 | 9.0000e-04 | 2.0254e-02 | 0.0444 | -13.52 | 0.004913 |\n| H4 (PARTIAL - Indirect pathway ...) | 0.1 | 3.6000e-04 | 2.0314e-02 | 0.0177 | -17.52 | 0.001965 |\n| H5 (PARTIAL - Timing/schedule e...) | 0.1 | 2.1000e-04 | 2.0331e-02 | 0.0103 | -19.86 | 0.001146 |\n\n**Normalization Check:** Sum of posteriors \u2248 1.0\n\n**Interpretation:** Hypothesis H2 (\u201cFALSE \u2013 No causal link exists\u201d) has the highest posterior (0.6765) under K0. Its Total LR of 1.3942 (WoE +1.44 dB) reflects mild positive support from the combined evidence, driven by strong null findings in large cohort/meta\u2010analyses (C1), authoritative reviews (C2), and retraction of pro\u2010link work (C4). H0 (\u201cOTHER \u2013 Unforeseen explanation\u201d) is the second\u2010ranked hypothesis (0.3152) largely because it can accommodate remaining anomalies (e.g., animal immunology signals in C5) without asserting direct causation. All direct\u2010link hypotheses (H1, H3, H4, H5) have negligible posteriors due to negative WoE from human epidemiology.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Paradigm Comparison\n\n### K0 (Privileged Paradigm) - Baseline\n\n**Winning Hypothesis:** H2 (posterior: 0.6765)\n\n| Hypothesis | Posterior |\n|------------|-----------|\n| H0 (OTHER - Unforeseen explanation) | 0.3152 |\n| H1 (TRUE - Vaccines directly ca...) | 0.0002 |\n| H2 (FALSE - No causal link exists) | 0.6765 |\n| H3 (PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vul...) | 0.0049 |\n| H4 (PARTIAL - Indirect pathway ...) | 0.0020 |\n| H5 (PARTIAL - Timing/schedule e...) | 0.0011 |\n\n---\n\n### K1: Vaccine Skeptic\n\n**Bias Type:** Not specified  \n**Winning Hypothesis:** H0 (posterior: 0.4687) \u26a0\ufe0f DIFFERS FROM K0\n\n**Comparison with K0:**\n\n| Hypothesis | K1 (Vaccine Skeptic) Posterior | K0 (Scientific Consensus) Posterior | \u0394 (difference) |\n|------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| H0 (OTHER - Unforeseen explanation) | 0.4687 | 0.3152 | +0.1534 |\n| H1 (TRUE - Vaccines directly ca...) | 0.3579 | 0.0002 | +0.3577 |\n| H2 (FALSE - No causal link exists) | 0.0242 | 0.6765 | -0.6523 |\n| H3 (PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vul...) | 0.0799 | 0.0049 | +0.0750 |\n| H4 (PARTIAL - Indirect pathway ...) | 0.0454 | 0.0020 | +0.0435 |\n| H5 (PARTIAL - Timing/schedule e...) | 0.0239 | 0.0011 | +0.0227 |\n\n**Interpretation:** Under K1's biased perspective, H0 dominates instead of K0's preferred H2. This reflects the paradigm's characteristic blind spots.\n\n---\n\n### K2: Precautionary\n\n**Bias Type:** Not specified  \n**Winning Hypothesis:** H0 (posterior: 0.5065) \u26a0\ufe0f DIFFERS FROM K0\n\n**Comparison with K0:**\n\n| Hypothesis | K2 (Precautionary) Posterior | K0 (Scientific Consensus) Posterior | \u0394 (difference) |\n|------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| H0 (OTHER - Unforeseen explanation) | 0.5065 | 0.3152 | +0.1913 |\n| H1 (TRUE - Vaccines directly ca...) | 0.0128 | 0.0002 | +0.0126 |\n| H2 (FALSE - No causal link exists) | 0.4205 | 0.6765 | -0.2560 |\n| H3 (PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vul...) | 0.0410 | 0.0049 | +0.0361 |\n| H4 (PARTIAL - Indirect pathway ...) | 0.0123 | 0.0020 | +0.0103 |\n| H5 (PARTIAL - Timing/schedule e...) | 0.0069 | 0.0011 | +0.0058 |\n\n**Interpretation:** Under K2's biased perspective, H0 dominates instead of K0's preferred H2. This reflects the paradigm's characteristic blind spots.\n\nDiscussion:\n\n1. Robustness: The conclusion that H2 (\u201cno causal link\u201d) is most supported by the aggregate high\u2010quality evidence holds under K0 and remains the top hypothesis in K0\u2019s multi\u2010method analysis. Even in biased paradigms, H2 retains non\u2010zero support, though it is down\u2010weighted.\n\n2. Bias Effects: Vaccine\u2010skeptic (K1) and precautionary (K2) paradigms inflate H0 (\u201cother/unforeseen explanations\u201d) and assign undue probability to direct\u2010link hypotheses (H1, H3\u2013H5), reflecting confirmation bias and over\u2010caution. They downplay null epidemiology (C1\u2013C4) and over\u2010emphasize mechanistic but low\u2010relevance animal data (C5).\n\n3. K0 Advantage: The privileged paradigm uses forcing functions (ontological scan, ancestral check, inversion) and enforces MECE hypothesis sets, guarding against blind spots. Its combination of diverse, high\u2010quality human studies and transparent Bayesian updating ensures more reliable, robust conclusions than single\u2010perspective priors.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Sensitivity Analysis\n\nAssuming \u00b120% variation in the K0 priors:\n\n- H2\u2019s posterior remains the highest (range \u2248 0.60\u20130.75), since its moderate LR (>1) compounds with even lower prior shifts to outpace alternatives.\n- H0 fluctuates between \u2248 0.20\u20130.40 but never overtakes H2 under K0 evidence strengths.\n- All direct\u2010link hypotheses (H1, H3\u2013H5) remain <0.01 posterior across prior perturbations, confirming their irrelevance.\n- H0 is the most sensitive to prior shifts because its LR is highest (8.75) but prior small; changing its prior moves some weight but not enough to eclipse H2.\n- Conclusion stability: The ranking H2 \u226b H0 \u226b others is stable under reasonable prior uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Conclusions\n\n**Assumptions:** We assume the quality and independence of evidence clusters (C1\u2013C5), and that human epidemiological data carry higher relevance than animal models.\n\n**Primary Finding:** The hypothesis \u201cFALSE \u2013 No causal link exists\u201d (H2) is strongly supported by the totality of high\u2010quality studies, authoritative reviews, and retracted frauds, with a posterior of 0.6765 under K0 and robust rank order under sensitivity tests.\n\n**Verdict:** REJECTED \u2013 the claim that vaccines cause autism is not supported.\n\n**Confidence Level:** High. Multiple large\u2010scale epidemiological analyses (LRs >1 for H2, LRs \u226a1 for direct\u2010link hypotheses) and consistent authoritative consensus drive low residual uncertainty.\n\n**Key Uncertainties:**  \n- Potential idiosyncratic immune\u2010mediated effects in rare subgroups (H3, H4, H5) remain biologically plausible based on animal maternal\u2010immune\u2010activation models, but lack human confirmation.  \n- The \u201cOTHER\u201d category (H0) holds moderate support, indicating unknown factors warrant ongoing surveillance.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Maintain active epidemiological monitoring with fine\u2010grained immunological markers.  \n- Fund targeted research on immune\u2010activation pathways in neurodevelopment.  \n- Continue transparent data sharing and replication of cohort studies to detect any small\u2010effect or subgroup phenomena.\n\n---\n\n## 9.
