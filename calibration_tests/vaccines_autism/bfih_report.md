# BFIH Analysis Report: Do vaccines cause autism in children?

**Analysis conducted using Bayesian Framework for Intellectual Honesty (BFIH)**

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict:** REJECTED

Under the integrated evidence synthesis paradigm (K0), the probability of an unforeseen primary driver (H0) explaining persistent concerns about vaccines and autism is virtually zero (P=0.0089). Instead, the leading explanations are institutional distrust and psychological heuristics (H1, P=0.2875) and algorithmic misinformation amplification (H2, P=0.2530). Across all hypotheses, there is no support for a direct causal link between vaccination and autism.

The most probable driver under K0 is H1 (institutional distrust and heuristics), reflecting deep skepticism toward medical authorities and cognitive biases that prioritize anecdote over data. Under K1 (industry-centric technocrat), H1 is even stronger (P=0.4078). Other paradigms highlight different dominant factors: K2 (parent advocates) emphasizes legacy pharmaceutical misconduct (H5, P=0.4222), K3 (libertarian autonomy) points to anti-establishment narratives (H3, P=0.5637), and K4 (precautionary futurist) focuses on educational and science-literacy gaps (H4, P=0.2231).

Key evidence includes large-scale epidemiological and meta-analytic studies showing no increased autism risk post-vaccination (likelihood ratios strongly <1 for causation), mechanistic biology refuting plausible pathways, and analyses of social-media algorithms that amplify emotive content. Surveys of public trust and cognitive experiments further substantiate the prominence of H1 and H2.

The conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism is robust across all paradigms. However, strategies to address residual concern should be tailored: rebuilding institutional trust, countering misinformation algorithms, addressing historical grievances, enhancing science literacy, and engaging theological and liberty-focused communities.

## 2. Hypothesis Set

**H0: OTHER - Unforeseen primary driver**

This hypothesis proposes that some unknown or unmodeled factor is the true root cause of persistent vaccine–autism concerns. It allows for the possibility of novel social, genetic, or environmental influences not captured by other categories. Under K0 it is deemed highly unlikely given comprehensive data.

**Prior Probabilities:**

**H1: Institutional distrust & psychological heuristics**

This hypothesis claims that skepticism toward medical and governmental institutions, combined with cognitive biases (e.g., availability, confirmation), fuels belief in a vaccine–autism link. Anecdotes of adverse events are overweighted relative to statistical evidence. Distrust arises from past missteps and perceived opacity.

**Prior Probabilities:**

---

**H4: Educational and science-literacy gaps**

This hypothesis claims that insufficient science education and lack of critical thinking skills leave individuals vulnerable to false causal claims. Poor understanding of statistics and risk magnifies anecdotal evidence.

**Prior Probabilities:**

| Paradigm    | Prior P(H) | Rationale                                                                                  |

Discussion:

1. Robustness: Hypothesis H1 (“Institutional distrust & psychological heuristics”) emerges as the best-supported explanation under both K0 and the institutional K1 paradigm, indicating this result holds across maximally unbiased and pro-industry perspectives. No paradigm elevates H0 (“Unforeseen driver”), so the core finding—that belief in a vaccine–autism link is not due to some unknown cause—is paradigm-independent. Other drivers (H2, H3, H5, H6, H7) become dominant only under paradigms with clear blind spots.

2. Bias Effects: Each biased paradigm overweights evidence that fits its worldview. K0-inv emphasizes theological objections (H6), K2 cognitive bias misses institutional trust issues in favor of alternative-medicine incentives (H5), K3 ideological autonomy magnifies moral objections (H3), and K4’s risk-averse stance amplifies educational-gap concerns (H4). These blind spots lead to divergent “winning” hypotheses.

3. K0 Advantage: The privileged K0 paradigm enforces ontological scans, ancestral checks and paradigm inversion, integrating all evidence clusters without undue weighting. This multi-domain, forcing-function-compliant analysis minimizes blind spots and yields the most reliable inference.

---

## 7. Sensitivity Analysis

When varying all priors by ±20%, the ranking under K0 remains stable: H1 retains the top position unless its prior falls below ~0.15, which is outside the ±20% window from 0.25. H2 stays second, and H0 remains negligible. Hypotheses with LRs close to 1.0 (H3, H5, H7) exhibit moderate shifts but do not overtake H1 or H2. H4 and H6 (LR<1) remain suppressed. Thus, the conclusion that institutional distrust (H1) is primary is robust; H2 is the next most sensitive but never surpasses H1.

---

## 8. Conclusions

**Primary Finding:** There is no credible evidence that vaccines cause autism. The persistence of the vaccine–autism belief is best explained by institutional distrust and psychological heuristics (H1), supplemented by algorithmic misinformation amplification (H2).

**Verdict:** REJECTED (the causal hypothesis is unsupported)

**Confidence Level:** High—meta-analyses yield strong negative evidence against causation (C1), and Bayesian updating under multiple paradigms consistently disfavors a direct vaccine–autism link.

**Key Uncertainties:** The relative contributions of H2 versus H1 may vary by community context; minor residual paradigm-dependent effects (H3, H5) merit localized study.

**Recommendations:**  
- Enhance transparency and accountability in public health institutions to rebuild trust.  
- Counter misinformation through algorithmic de-amplification and science-literacy campaigns.  
- Monitor social-media trends to address emergent narrative shifts promptly.
