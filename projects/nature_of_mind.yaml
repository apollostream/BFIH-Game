# A multi-analysis investigation into consciousness, understanding, identity,

# This configuration defines a network of interconnected philosophical questions

    This project examines fundamental questions about the nature of mind
    through the lens of artificial intelligence. Beginning with the question
    of machine consciousness, it branches into investigations of illusionism,
    understanding, personal identity, and moral status - each analysis building
    on and informing the others in a hermeneutic spiral toward integrated
    philosophical understanding.

# TOPIC NETWORK
# =============================================================================
# Topics are arranged in a dependency graph. Each topic can depend on prior
# topics, and when context_from_prior is true, the findings from dependencies
# are injected into the analysis as contextual framing.

topics:

# META-ANALYSIS

# The meta-analysis synthesizes findings from all component analyses,
# treating their conclusions as evidence for evaluating grand synthesis
# hypotheses about the nature of mind.

  proposition: "What unified theory of mind best accounts for the pattern of findings across consciousness, understanding, identity, and moral status?"

  hypotheses:
    - id: H1
      name: "Functionalist Coherentism"
      description: |
        Mental properties are constituted by functional roles within information-processing
        systems. Consciousness, understanding, and moral status all reduce to appropriate
        functional organization. Artificial systems can in principle instantiate these
        roles and thereby possess genuine mentality.

    - id: H2
      name: "Biological Exceptionalism"
      description: |
        Genuine mentality requires biological substrate with specific causal powers.
        Artificial systems, regardless of functional similarity, lack the intrinsic
        biological properties necessary for consciousness and understanding. They
        remain sophisticated but philosophically empty mimics.

    - id: H3
      name: "Graded Mentality"
      description: |
        Mental properties exist on a continuum rather than as binary categories.
        Different systems instantiate different degrees of consciousness, understanding,
        and moral status. Artificial systems may possess partial or proto-mental
        properties without full human-like mentality.

    - id: H4
      name: "Eliminative Pluralism"
      description: |
        Folk mental concepts (consciousness, understanding, identity) are too coarse
        to carve nature at its joints. We need new vocabulary distinguishing different
        phenomena currently bundled under these terms. The question of machine consciousness
        may be malformed as stated.

    - id: H5
      name: "Panpsychist Integration"
      description: |
        Consciousness is a fundamental feature of reality, not emergent from non-conscious
        matter. Both biological and artificial systems partake of this fundamental
        property to different degrees based on their information integration patterns.
        The question is not whether machines can be conscious but how.

    - id: H6
      name: "Pragmatic Deflationism"
      description: |
        Metaphysical questions about the intrinsic nature of machine minds are
        permanently underdetermined. What matters is functional capability, behavioral
        dispositions, and practical implications for ethics and policy. The debate
        over "genuine" consciousness is ultimately unresolvable and unnecessary.
