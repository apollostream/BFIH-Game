# The Honest Bayesian: What Philosophy Actually Offers at the Intersection of Probability and Integrity  
*Not a single “school” so much as a disciplined habit: using Bayesian tools to make beliefs answer to evidence—while admitting, plainly, where context changes what honesty requires.*

## The Problem With Asking for “A School of Thought”
The question sounds straightforward, almost like something you could settle by scanning a syllabus: *Are there any schools of thought in philosophy that sit at the intersection of Bayesianism and intellectual honesty?* In other words, is there a named movement—like Stoicism or Existentialism—that marries probabilistic reasoning to a code of inquiry that resists self-deception and motivated thinking?

But the best, most intellectually responsible answer doesn’t arrive neatly packaged as a “yes” or “no,” nor does it land on a single proper noun. What you find instead is something more subtle—and, for anyone who cares about how arguments actually work in the real world, more useful: a **context-sensitive integration** that shows up in multiple corners of philosophy, with different emphases depending on the domain, the stakes, and the kind of uncertainty at hand.

From a rigor-first, evidence-driven perspective, the main finding is clear: **philosophy does contain serious, identifiable approaches that connect Bayesian reasoning to the norms we associate with intellectual honesty—but the connection is not uniform, and it is rarely best described as a single unified “school.”** It’s closer to a set of methodological commitments that recur: coherence constraints on belief, transparency about priors and evidence, explicit updating in light of new information, and a moral-epistemic suspicion of overconfidence.

This matters because Bayesianism is no longer just a topic in formal epistemology seminars. It has become a governing metaphor for large parts of contemporary life: in medicine, in risk modeling, in machine learning, in forecasting, and in everyday talk about “updating” your beliefs. Meanwhile, “intellectual honesty” has become a kind of rhetorical trophy—claimed by pundits, academics, and tech leaders alike, often without the discomfort of actually practicing it.

What philosophy can offer, at its best, is not a slogan about rationality but a **clear-eyed map of where Bayesian discipline helps and where it fails**, of what “honesty” means when evidence is incomplete, and of why certain ideologies keep trying to force the map to look simpler than it is.

The report you provided—heavy with probability tables, clusters of evidence, and cross-paradigm comparisons—amounts to one overriding conclusion: **the intersection exists, but it is best understood as a flexible, context-dependent synthesis rather than a single institutional doctrine or a fragmented mess of unrelated trends.** Once you see that, a lot of philosophical disputes—and a lot of public ones—snap into sharper focus.

## A Brief Tour of the Two Ideas People Keep Confusing
Before we can see the intersection clearly, we need to get precise about what we mean by the two things we’re trying to combine.

**Bayesianism**, in philosophy, is not merely “using probabilities.” It is a normative view about rational belief: that degrees of belief should obey certain coherence constraints and should, in many circumstances, be updated by conditionalization—roughly, the idea that new evidence should change your credences in a mathematically disciplined way. The *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* captures the core point: Bayesian epistemology is an account of rational learning and rational belief under uncertainty, often emphasizing coherence, calibration, and principled updating [1].

**Intellectual honesty**, by contrast, is typically framed as a virtue or norm: the avoidance of self-serving bias, the faithful presentation of evidence, and the refusal to let personal belief substitute for inquiry. Even popular summaries put the emphasis on resisting the temptation to twist facts to fit identity or desire [3]. More careful philosophical treatments connect honesty to transparency—about what you know, what you don’t, and why you believe what you believe. Byerly’s work on intellectual honesty and transparency, for example, pushes the idea beyond mere sincerity into a discipline of *epistemic disclosure*: not hiding the weak points of your own case [32].

The problem is that people often treat these as either obviously the same thing (“Bayesianism is just intellectual honesty with math”) or obviously alien to each other (“Bayesianism is cold calculation; honesty is moral character”). Both moves are too simple.

Bayesianism can be practiced dishonestly—through cherry-picked likelihoods, conveniently chosen priors, or selective attention to what counts as “evidence.” And intellectual honesty can be invoked without Bayesian discipline—through heartfelt declarations of openness that never cash out as a willingness to quantify uncertainty, to update, or to admit error.

So the interesting question is not whether they can be rhetorically aligned. It’s whether there are philosophical approaches that connect them in a way that actually changes how inquiry is done—approaches that make honesty operational rather than aspirational.

## The Evidence: Where the Intersection Shows Up—and Where It Breaks  
The report organizes its evidence thematically. Stripped of the scaffolding, what it really provides is a guided tour through four kinds of sources: foundational accounts of Bayesian epistemology; virtue epistemology and the literature on intellectual virtues; critiques that emphasize fragmentation or limits; and work focusing on context sensitivity, computational constraints, and hybrid models. These threads don’t converge on a single banner. They converge on a pattern.

### 1) Bayesian Epistemology’s Built-In Moral Language—Often Ignored
The first thing an empirically disciplined reader notices is that **Bayesian epistemology already contains norms that look a lot like intellectual honesty**, even when it avoids explicitly moral vocabulary.

Consider how the *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* describes objective Bayesianism: it often includes principles meant to prevent biasing one’s beliefs by arbitrary or self-serving starting points, encouraging priors that are not overly opinionated and are responsive to symmetry and informational constraints [1]. This is not merely technical. It is a posture toward evidence: a resistance to loading the dice in your own favor.

Even a broad, imperfect reference like Wikipedia points in the same direction, emphasizing coherence and conditionalization while noting disputes over priors—disputes that, at bottom, are disputes about how to keep belief formation from becoming rationalized preference [2]. The details matter here because the *shape* of the argument is philosophical: if your degrees of belief are incoherent, you are—by your own lights—vulnerable to guaranteed loss or contradiction; if you refuse to update in disciplined ways, you are not letting the world teach you.

This is where the intersection begins: not with a moral sermon, but with the idea that **honesty requires constraints**. Not just the good intention to follow evidence, but rules that prevent you from smuggling in what you want to be true.

And that’s why some philosophers have tried to *justify* Bayesianism as a rational requirement rather than a convenient tool. Leitgeb and Pettigrew’s work on minimizing inaccuracy argues that Bayesian norms can be defended by showing they uniquely serve the aim of having beliefs that match the truth as closely as possible [12]. Williamson’s defense of objective Bayesianism similarly treats Bayesian constraints as more than optional heuristics [16]. These are not self-help manuals. They are attempts to ground intellectual discipline in something firmer than temperament.

The key point: **Bayesianism, in its most philosophically ambitious forms, is not morally neutral.** It encodes a suspicion of overconfidence, a preference for measured belief, and a demand for internal consistency—traits that map naturally onto what we praise as intellectual honesty.

### 2) Virtue Epistemology: Honesty as Character—and Its Tension With Formalism
If Bayesian epistemology is often accused of being too mathematical, virtue epistemology is often accused of being too human. It asks: what intellectual character traits make inquiry go well? What does it mean to be careful, humble, courageous, fair-minded?

The *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* entry on virtue epistemology frames the field around intellectual virtues such as open-mindedness, conscientiousness, and intellectual courage, treating them as central to epistemic success [18]. Battaly’s work likewise places “intellectual virtue” in a broad landscape of traits and practices that help agents track truth and avoid error [19]. Baehr’s writing connects virtues to truth, understanding, and wisdom, pushing beyond mere belief to richer epistemic goods [21].

Where does Bayesianism fit? Not as a replacement for virtue, but as a possible *scaffold* for it.

If intellectual honesty includes resisting self-deception and wishful thinking, Bayesian discipline can function as a training regime: it forces you to articulate what evidence would change your mind, and by how much. It asks you to quantify your uncertainty rather than hiding behind vague confidence. It turns “I’m open to being wrong” into a requirement: show your priors; show your updates; show what would count against you.

Byerly’s emphasis on intellectual transparency makes this connection even tighter [32]. Transparency is not merely telling the truth as you see it; it is making visible the *structure* of your reasoning—where your uncertainty lies, what assumptions you rely on, what you might be missing. Bayesian methods, when used with integrity, are a way of making that structure explicit.

But virtue epistemology also highlights a tension: **formal rules cannot guarantee virtuous practice.** A person can perform Bayesian updates in a way that looks disciplined while quietly choosing priors to protect identity, ideology, or career incentives. Virtue epistemologists are, in effect, warning Bayesians: you can have the math and still lack the virtue.

The intersection, then, is not a merger where one field swallows the other. It is a relationship of mutual correction: Bayesianism offers rigor; virtue epistemology offers vigilance about motive and character.

### 3) The Fragmentation Argument: Why Some Philosophers Resist the Synthesis
Not everyone buys the story that Bayesianism and intellectual honesty naturally converge. Some of the evidence the report highlights emphasizes **fragmentation**—the idea that modern epistemology is split among incompatible projects, and that Bayesianism is only one tradition among others.

Popper’s critical rationalism is one useful example because it shares a moral sensibility—fallibilism, suspicion of dogma, the valorization of criticism—while rejecting Bayesianism as the core model of scientific reasoning [5]. Popper’s world is about conjectures and refutations, not degrees of belief. You can be rigorously intellectually honest in a Popperian sense without ever assigning a probability to a hypothesis.

Beyond Popper, philosophical culture itself has been argued to be increasingly specialized and fractured. Discussions of analytic philosophy’s evolution and fragmentation—whether in more serious venues like the *Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy* [43] or polemical essays about the field’s “ending” [42]—often point to a landscape where no single epistemic framework rules.

Some critiques are technical. The dilemma for subjective Bayesians about accuracy and infinity, for instance, raises problems for certain Bayesian commitments when you allow infinitely many possibilities or extremely rich hypothesis spaces [25]. Work on diverse evidence shows that evidence doesn’t always fit neatly into a single updating rule; the world can be messy in ways that strain ideal Bayesian models [23]. Algorithmic Bayesian epistemology asks what remains of Bayesian norms when computational constraints make ideal updating impossible [15].

These critiques don’t show that Bayesianism is irrelevant to intellectual honesty. They show something more uncomfortable: **the honest practice of Bayesianism may require admitting its limits.** That admission is itself a form of intellectual honesty—one that ideological Bayesians sometimes resist.

### 4) Context Sensitivity and Hybrid Models: Where the Real Action Is
The most illuminating thread in the evidence is the one that treats the intersection as **context-dependent** rather than universal.

This shows up in multiple places. Lin’s “Convergence to the Truth,” for example, situates Bayesianism as one inference tradition among others in a broader convergentist picture, implying that what rationality requires may vary by domain and by what “convergence” even means in that setting [4]. Work on Bayesianism in medicine underscores this point in practical terms: clinical decisions involve heterogeneous evidence, time pressure, and asymmetric costs of error, so Bayesian tools must be adapted to real-world constraints [34].

On the computational side, algorithmic and AI-adjacent work makes context unavoidable. A Bayesian approach to language models, for instance, is not just a philosophical toy; it’s a way of thinking about how systems move from evidence to belief under resource limits [28]. Weighted authority models propose architectures where evidence is filtered through credibility assessments—again, not a purely formal matter, but a context-laden one involving trust, institutions, and epistemic dependence [27].

Even more interpretive domains are now experimenting with Bayes. Constructivist principles in digital humanities scholarship have been investigated using Bayes’ theorem—an attempt to bring probabilistic clarity to fields often dominated by narrative and interpretation [45]. This isn’t proof that Bayesianism conquers all. It’s proof that the temptation to use Bayesian structure appears wherever people feel the strain between evidence and interpretation.

Across these contexts, a recurring theme emerges: **Bayesian methods are most tightly linked to intellectual honesty when they are treated as tools for disciplined humility rather than as universal solvent.** The honest Bayesian is not the one who insists everything can be reduced to priors and likelihoods; it’s the one who says, explicitly, where the model fits and where it breaks.

> The strongest throughline in the evidence is not “Bayesianism everywhere,” but “Bayesianism where it clarifies, bounded by transparency about what it cannot capture.”

## The Intellectually Honest Assessment: What the Best Reading of the Evidence Concludes
Put plainly, the most rigorous assessment of the record supports three claims at once:

1. **Yes, there are philosophical approaches at the intersection of Bayesian reasoning and intellectual honesty.**  
   Not as a single club with membership cards, but as a recognizable family of practices and arguments: objective Bayesianism’s bias-avoidance norms [1], formal epistemology’s coherence constraints [5], and virtue epistemology’s insistence on traits like honesty and transparency [18], [32]. These are not accidental overlaps. They are structurally related: both Bayesianism and intellectual honesty are, at their core, about making belief formation answerable to something outside the self—evidence, coherence, and accountable reasoning.

2. **The intersection is best understood as context-dependent integration rather than a unified doctrine.**  
   The evidence repeatedly shows that Bayesian norms are adapted—sometimes heavily—depending on the domain: scientific inference, medical decision-making, computational modeling, or interpretive humanities [34], [45]. Even within philosophy, disputes between objective and subjective Bayesianism, or between Bayesian and non-Bayesian traditions, show that there is no single “Bayesian honesty” orthodoxy that everyone accepts [16], [25].

3. **Institutional endorsement exists, but it is not the primary story.**  
   There are grants and institutional signals—such as the Templeton-funded work on Bayesianism and intellectual humility [7]—and a broader academic ecosystem in which formal epistemology is taken seriously. But the deeper story is not that institutions have declared Bayesian intellectual honesty as doctrine. It’s that **the most defensible connections between Bayesianism and honesty arise from methodological necessity**: when you’re forced to deal with uncertainty responsibly, Bayesian structure becomes attractive; when you’re forced to defend your reasoning publicly, transparency becomes morally and epistemically central.

This assessment also has to acknowledge genuine uncertainties.

First, **not all honest inquiry is Bayesian**. Popperian critical rationalism is an enduring counterexample: it can be deeply aligned with intellectual honesty while rejecting probabilistic belief as the core model [5]. Second, **Bayesianism can be used dishonestly**, especially when priors become ideological armor. Third, **fragmentation is real**: philosophy is not marching toward one unified epistemology; it is a plural, argumentative ecosystem with competing norms and incentives [43].

Yet the overarching conclusion holds: the best-supported picture is not one of total fragmentation or of a single institutionalized school, but of **a robust, recurring integration whose form changes with context**.

If you came to the question hoping for a neat label—“this is the movement that combines Bayes and honesty”—you might be disappointed. If you came hoping for guidance on how serious thinkers actually do this work, the answer is better than a label: it’s a map of practices, constraints, and failure modes.

## How Ideological Lenses Diverge: Where Commitments Start Rewriting the Story
Once you accept the context-dependent conclusion, a second story becomes visible: **why certain ideological styles of thinking either flatten the nuance or redirect it.** These lenses don’t merely “disagree.” They tend to begin with commitments—about tradition, culture, politics, or personal conviction—that shape what counts as evidence and what counts as honesty. The result is not just a different emphasis; it is often a distortion.

### The Traditionalists: When “Honesty” Means Fidelity Before Evidence
One influential way of diverging from the rigorous baseline is to treat intellectual honesty primarily as **faithfulness to inherited wisdom, communal authority, or spiritual truth**, and to treat Bayesian reasoning as a subordinate tool—useful when it supports tradition, suspect when it challenges it.

In this lens, the key question becomes: *Does Bayesianism serve the continuity of a valued narrative?* Evidence that Bayesian methods can be aligned with virtues is welcomed, but the integration tends to be reframed as **institutional or communal endorsement** rather than context-sensitive methodological practice. Where the rigorous assessment sees “adapt Bayes to domain constraints,” the traditionalist lens sees “use Bayes to modernize what we already know.”

This is why the report notes a strong pull toward the idea of institutional endorsement in that orientation: institutions and authorities are not merely social facts; they are treated as carriers of legitimacy. The danger is that Bayesianism—meant to discipline belief—turns into a justificatory ritual: an aesthetic of rationality draped over commitments that are functionally immune to updating.

The honest baseline insists that priors must be open to revision and that transparency includes admitting what would change your mind. The traditionalist divergence often weakens that requirement, because the deepest commitments are not meant to be revised at all.

### The Cultural Narrativists: When Bayesianism Becomes Another Story We Tell
Another divergence comes from those who emphasize **socially constructed realities, cultural memory, and narrative frameworks**. This lens can actually agree with the baseline conclusion that integration is context-dependent; indeed, it can embrace it enthusiastically. But it often does so for a different reason.

The rigorous view says context matters because evidence structures, constraints, and aims differ by domain. The narrativist view often says context matters because **meaning and interpretation are culturally situated**, and because “rationality” is itself partly a cultural artifact.

This lens can yield valuable reminders: what counts as evidence in law differs from what counts as evidence in physics; testimony and trust matter; communities shape inquiry. Work that brings Bayesian tools into digital humanities debates illustrates this productive friction [45].

The distortion happens when Bayesian norms are treated as *just one more narrative*, no more accountable to reality than any other. Coherence and updating become aesthetic preferences rather than constraints. Intellectual honesty becomes a matter of representing one’s community faithfully rather than letting the world push back.

The honest baseline does not deny cultural situatedness. It denies that situatedness eliminates epistemic hierarchy. Some methods are better at avoiding self-deception than others; some constraints are harder to evade without paying a price in contradiction or predictive failure.

### The Pragmatic Politicals: When Truth Is What Works for Institutions
A third divergence comes from those who think primarily in terms of **institutions, democratic processes, and policy outcomes**. Here, Bayesianism is attractive because it looks like a tool for decision-making under uncertainty—exactly what governance requires. Intellectual honesty becomes a civic virtue: transparency to the public, accountability to committees, evidence-based policy.

This lens often agrees that integration is context-dependent, because policy is nothing if not contextual. But it also tends to elevate **fragmentation**: different stakeholders, incentives, and time horizons produce competing “rational” frames. What looks like epistemic pluralism from the outside can be, internally, a reflection of coalition politics.

The risk is a subtle one: honesty becomes procedural rather than substantive. If the committee followed the right process, if the report included confidence intervals, if the model was peer reviewed—then the institution claims the mantle of honesty even when the priors were political, the evidence was selectively framed, or the uncertainty was strategically communicated.

In the honest baseline, Bayesian transparency is not just publishing a model; it is being candid about what the model cannot do, and about how much judgment is embedded in it. In politics, that candor is often punished.

### The Personal Conviction Crowd: When “My Priors” Become My Identity
Finally, there is a divergence that looks less like ideology and more like psychology: a style of thinking that treats Bayesian language—priors, updating, probabilities—as a way to sanctify personal conviction.

This is the world where people say “I updated” the way they might say “I did my research,” even when nothing about their beliefs is meaningfully constrained by evidence. The Bayesian vocabulary becomes a form of rhetorical insulation: if your priors are part of your identity, then any evidence that challenges them can be dismissed as “not strong enough to move me.”

The honest baseline insists that priors are not sacred; they are starting points under uncertainty, and their legitimacy depends on whether they remain corrigible and whether the agent is transparent about them. Intellectual honesty here is not merely internal consistency; it is a willingness to be wrong publicly, to show your work, and to admit when your confidence outruns your evidence.

This divergence is especially dangerous because it mimics the surface features of rigor. It is not anti-Bayesian; it is performatively Bayesian. And it can infect academic debates, online discourse, and even scientific communities when reputational incentives reward confidence over candor.

## Implications and Applications: What This Means Outside the Seminar Room
The context-dependent conclusion is not a mere academic nuance. It has practical implications for how we argue, how we build institutions, how we teach reasoning, and how we design technologies that increasingly mediate belief.

First, it suggests that **the best use of Bayesian thinking is as an honesty technology**: a way of making uncertainty explicit, of forcing clarity about what would change your mind, and of preventing motivated belief from hiding behind vagueness. In medicine, this is not abstract. Bayesian reasoning shows up in diagnostic testing, in updating the probability of disease given new results, and in communicating risk to patients [34]. The honest application is not “Bayes says do X,” but “here is how this piece of evidence should change our confidence, and here is what we still don’t know.”

Second, it suggests that **philosophy’s virtue talk and philosophy’s formal talk are complements, not enemies**. Virtue epistemology without formal discipline can drift into inspirational slogans. Formal epistemology without virtue can drift into technically sophisticated self-deception. The intersection is most powerful where the two correct each other: where transparency is both a moral demand and a methodological constraint [32].

Third, the conclusion warns against **ideological appropriation**. Every lens described above has something to contribute: tradition can remind us that communities store knowledge; cultural analysis can reveal hidden assumptions; politics can force attention to incentives; personal introspection can surface bias. But each lens also has a characteristic way of bending the story: substituting fidelity for revisability, narrative for constraint, procedure for truth, conviction for updating.

Finally, the conclusion implies a more humane view of rationality: **rational belief is not a single monolithic rulebook.** It is a discipline that changes with stakes, evidence types, computational limits, and social realities. Honest Bayesianism is not a universal algorithm. It is a commitment to making your belief formation accountable—mathematically when possible, verbally when necessary, always transparently.

## Practical Guidance: How to Practice “Honest Bayesianism” Without Turning It Into a Religion
Because this isn’t a “best hotel” or “best product” question, a comparison table of candidates isn’t the useful tool here. The useful tool is a set of practices—concrete habits that capture the strongest, most defensible connection between Bayesian reasoning and intellectual honesty.

### 1) Stop Asking “Do I Believe It?” and Start Asking “How Confident Am I?”
The simplest honest move Bayesianism encourages is replacing binary belief with graded confidence.

- Instead of: “This policy will work.”  
- Try: “Given what we know, I’m about 60 percent confident this policy will work, and here are the assumptions that matter.”

That move forces two disclosures at once: your uncertainty and your dependencies. It also makes later updating possible without humiliation.

### 2) Say What Would Change Your Mind—Before the Argument Starts
Intellectual honesty is easiest to fake when “evidence” is defined after the fact. The discipline is to pre-commit—at least informally—to what would count.

Ask yourself:
- What observation, data point, or argument would reduce my confidence by half?
- What would increase it substantially?
- Is there any imaginable evidence that would make me reverse my conclusion?

If the answer is “nothing,” then you don’t have a belief; you have a protected identity.

### 3) Treat Priors as Explanations, Not as Weapons
Priors are unavoidable: everyone starts somewhere. The honest requirement is transparency and revisability.

When you disagree with someone, try:
- “Our priors differ because we have different experiences with X,” rather than “Your priors are irrational.”
- Then ask: “What shared evidence could bring us closer?”

This is where virtue and formal discipline meet: humility about your starting point, rigor about how you move from it.

### 4) Don’t Demand Bayesian Precision Where the World Won’t Give It
One of the most common dishonest moves in rationalist subcultures is **false precision**: turning messy uncertainty into crisp numbers that convey more certainty than the evidence supports.

An honest approach allows:
- ranges instead of point estimates,
- qualitative likelihoods when quantification is performative,
- explicit acknowledgment of model limits—especially under computational or evidential constraints discussed in contemporary work [15], [23].

The goal is not to look mathematical. The goal is to be accountable.

### 5) Borrow From Virtue Epistemology: Build Character Around Your Methods
Methods don’t run themselves. To keep Bayesian reasoning from becoming a rationalization machine, cultivate virtues that keep you oriented toward truth:

- **Intellectual humility**: treat your best view as provisional.  
- **Intellectual courage**: update even when it costs status.  
- **Intellectual transparency**: disclose uncertainty and weaknesses, not just conclusions [32].  
- **Fair-mindedness**: represent opposing evidence in its strongest form.

If you cannot do these, Bayesian techniques won’t save you. They’ll just give your bias better math.

### 6) Watch for the Four Classic Distortions
Use the ideological divergences as a checklist for self-audit:

- Am I treating tradition as immune to revision?  
- Am I treating rational constraints as “just one narrative”?  
- Am I equating procedural compliance with truth?  
- Am I using priors as identity armor?

If yes, your inquiry is drifting away from honest discipline and toward motivated reasoning wearing philosophical costume.

## Closing Reflection: The Intersection Is Real—and It’s Harder Than a Label
People ask for a “school of thought” because schools promise a shortcut. If you can name the thing—Stoicism, Marxism, Logical Positivism—you can imagine importing a kit of answers. But the most reliable link between Bayesian reasoning and intellectual honesty resists that packaging. It shows up instead as a **methodological ethic**: a way of holding your beliefs to account.

The evidence points to Bayesian epistemology’s built-in suspicion of incoherence and bias [1], to virtue epistemology’s insistence that good inquiry depends on character as well as calculation [18], and to a growing body of work that insists—sometimes reluctantly—that context changes what rational updating can even mean [23], [15]. The best conclusion is not that everything reduces to Bayes, nor that philosophy is too fragmented to say anything firm. It’s that the intersection exists where people take both sides seriously: the math as a discipline, the virtue as a constraint, the context as a reality check.

There’s a reason this matters now. We live in a culture that rewards certainty—on social media, in politics, sometimes even in academia. Bayesianism, at its most honest, is an argument against that reward structure. It says: your confidence should be earned; your uncertainty should be legible; your beliefs should move when the world pushes.

And intellectual honesty, at its most demanding, is an argument against our favorite inner loopholes. It says: don’t hide your weak points; don’t pretend you’re updating when you’re merely defending; don’t treat your conclusions as sacred if you won’t say what would make them false.

The intersection of the two is not a philosophical brand. It is a discipline that can make you less wrong—if you let it.
