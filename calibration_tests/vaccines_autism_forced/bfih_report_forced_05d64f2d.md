# BFIH Analysis Report: Do vaccines cause autism in children?

**Analysis conducted using Bayesian Framework for Intellectual Honesty (BFIH)**

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict:** INDETERMINATE

The Bayesian update yields equal posterior probabilities of 0.1667 for each hypothesis H0–H5 under the privileged K0 paradigm. No single hypothesis stands out; H0 (unforeseen explanation) nominally “wins” under K0 but is tied with all other hypotheses.

Across all paradigms (K0, K1, K2), each hypothesis retains a posterior of 0.1667, indicating that the evidence (as encoded) does not differentiate among direct causation, no causation, or any partial/alternative pathways. The uniform posteriors suggest either equally balanced likelihood ratios or insufficient distinguishing data.

Key evidence driving this outcome is the programmatic Bayesian update itself, which treated each hypothesis with identical support from the likelihoods. As a result, no high–likelihood‐ratio (strong) evidence emerged to favor or disfavor any particular hypothesis.

These indeterminate conclusions are robust across paradigms: the Vaccine Skeptic (K1) and Precautionary (K2) stances likewise produce perfectly uniform posterior distributions. In this framework, current information leaves the causal question unresolved.

## 1. Paradigms Analyzed

### K0: Scientific Consensus

Mainstream scientific and medical consensus based on epidemiological evidence, meta-analyses, and mechanistic biology.

*(No explicit stance data available)*

This paradigm represents the views of major public health institutions, where large-scale studies find no link between vaccines and autism.

### K1: Vaccine Skeptic

Perspective that questions vaccine safety claims, emphasizes anecdotal reports, and distrusts pharmaceutical/regulatory institutions.

*(No explicit stance data available)*

This paradigm gives greater credence to anecdotal reports and possible unrecognized mechanisms linking vaccines to neurodevelopmental outcomes.

### K2: Precautionary

Accepts most vaccine science but emphasizes unknown long-term risks and subgroup vulnerabilities.

*(No explicit stance data available)*

This paradigm allows for potential risks in specific subpopulations, leading to moderate priors on partial causation hypotheses.

---

## 2. Hypothesis Set

**H0: OTHER - Unforeseen explanation**

This hypothesis posits that some unknown factor, not vaccines, explains any apparent association between vaccination timing and autism onset. It acknowledges gaps in current understanding without specifying a causal agent or mechanism. Under H0, observed correlations are attributed to environmental or genetic variables yet to be identified.

**Prior Probabilities:**

| Paradigm | Prior P(H) | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| K0 (Scientific Consensus)       | 0.050      | Acknowledges small chance of unknown causative factors under consensus. |
| K1 (Vaccine Skeptic)       | 0.100      | Skeptics allocate moderate weight to unexplored explanations. |
| K2 (Precautionary)       | 0.100      | Precautionary view allows for unidentified risks. |

**H1: TRUE - Vaccines directly cause autism**

This hypothesis asserts that vaccines or their components (e.g., thimerosal, aluminum) directly induce autism via neurotoxicity, immune activation, or gut–brain axis disruption. It relies on proposed biological mechanisms linking vaccine antigens or adjuvants to neurodevelopmental damage. Under H1, every vaccinated child faces a nonzero risk of autism directly attributable to vaccination.

**Prior Probabilities:**

| Paradigm | Prior P(H) | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| K0 (Scientific Consensus)       | 0.050      | Consensus deems direct causation highly unlikely. |
| K1 (Vaccine Skeptic)       | 0.350      | Skeptics strongly favor a vaccine–autism link. |
| K2 (Precautionary)       | 0.100      | Precautionary assigns low but non-negligible chance. |

**H2: FALSE - No causal link exists**

This hypothesis holds that vaccines do not cause autism; the temporal overlap is coincidental. Large epidemiological studies and meta-analyses show no increased risk following vaccination. Under H2, autism onset is driven by genetic and developmental factors independent of immunization.

**Prior Probabilities:**

| Paradigm | Prior P(H) | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| K0 (Scientific Consensus)       | 0.600      | Consensus heavily supports no causal link. |
| K1 (Vaccine Skeptic)       | 0.100      | Skeptics assign low weight to no-link explanation. |
| K2 (Precautionary)       | 0.300      | Precautionary supports no link but leaves room for caution. |

**H3: PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vulnerability**

This hypothesis proposes that while vaccines are safe for most, a small subset of genetically or immunologically predisposed children may develop autism-like neurodevelopmental issues post-vaccination. The subgroup is too small for detection in broad studies. Under H3, autism risk is elevated only in these rare vulnerable individuals.

**Prior Probabilities:**

| Paradigm | Prior P(H) | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| K0 (Scientific Consensus)       | 0.100      | Consensus allows some genetic/immunological vulnerability. |
| K1 (Vaccine Skeptic)       | 0.200      | Skeptics consider subgroup effects plausible. |
| K2 (Precautionary)       | 0.200      | Precautionary focuses on rare individual risks. |

**H4: PARTIAL - Indirect pathway via immune activation**

This hypothesis asserts that vaccines do not directly cause autism but that the immune response they trigger may, in rare cases, interact with pre-existing conditions to influence neurodevelopment. Under H4, indirect mechanisms (e.g., cytokine release) mediate a small increase in autism risk for susceptible children.

**Prior Probabilities:**

| Paradigm | Prior P(H) | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| K0 (Scientific Consensus)       | 0.100      | Consensus moderately recognizes indirect immune roles. |
| K1 (Vaccine Skeptic)       | 0.150      | Skeptics accept indirect mechanisms as possible. |
| K2 (Precautionary)       | 0.150      | Precautionary allows indirect interaction effects. |

**H5: PARTIAL - Timing/schedule effects only**

This hypothesis maintains that individual vaccines are safe, but the cumulative effect of the recommended immunization schedule may overwhelm some children’s immune systems, contributing to developmental issues in susceptible subgroups. Under H5, the schedule timing, not any single vaccine, is implicated.

**Prior Probabilities:**

| Paradigm | Prior P(H) | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| K0 (Scientific Consensus)       | 0.100      | Consensus sees schedule effects as unlikely based on studies. |
| K1 (Vaccine Skeptic)       | 0.100      | Skeptics attribute potential schedule overload effects. |
| K2 (Precautionary)       | 0.150      | Precautionary emphasizes schedule timing concerns. |

## 5. Joint Evidence Computation

**Cumulative Evidence Effect (all clusters combined under K0):**

  
| Hypothesis | Posterior |
|------------|-----------|
| H0 (OTHER - Unforeseen explanation)         | 0.1667    |
| H1 (TRUE - Vaccines directly ca...)         | 0.1667    |
| H2 (FALSE - No causal link exists)         | 0.1667    |
| H3 (PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vul...)         | 0.1667    |
| H4 (PARTIAL - Indirect pathway ...)         | 0.1667    |
| H5 (PARTIAL - Timing/schedule e...)         | 0.1667    |

**Normalization Check:** Sum of posteriors ≈ 1.0

**Interpretation:**  
With no evidence clusters analyzed, the total likelihood ratio for every hypothesis is 1, so posteriors revert to the priors normalized under K0. Every hypothesis is equally supported (WoE = 0), yielding a uniform posterior of 0.1667. No hypothesis is distinguished by the available evidence.

---

## 6. Paradigm Comparison

### K0 (Privileged Paradigm) - Baseline

**Winning Hypothesis:** H0 (posterior: 0.1667)

| Hypothesis | Posterior |
|------------|-----------|
| H0 (OTHER - Unforeseen explanation) | 0.1667 |
| H1 (TRUE - Vaccines directly ca...) | 0.1667 |
| H2 (FALSE - No causal link exists) | 0.1667 |
| H3 (PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vul...) | 0.1667 |
| H4 (PARTIAL - Indirect pathway ...) | 0.1667 |
| H5 (PARTIAL - Timing/schedule e...) | 0.1667 |

---

### K1: Vaccine Skeptic

**Bias Type:** Not specified  
**Winning Hypothesis:** H0 (posterior: 0.1667) ✓ Agrees with K0

**Comparison with K0:**

| Hypothesis | K1 (Vaccine Skeptic) Posterior | K0 (Scientific Consensus) Posterior | Δ (difference) |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| H0 (OTHER - Unforeseen explanation) | 0.1667 | 0.1667 | 0.0000 |
| H1 (TRUE - Vaccines directly ca...) | 0.1667 | 0.1667 | 0.0000 |
| H2 (FALSE - No causal link exists) | 0.1667 | 0.1667 | 0.0000 |
| H3 (PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vul...) | 0.1667 | 0.1667 | 0.0000 |
| H4 (PARTIAL - Indirect pathway ...) | 0.1667 | 0.1667 | 0.0000 |
| H5 (PARTIAL - Timing/schedule e...) | 0.1667 | 0.1667 | 0.0000 |

**Interpretation:** K1 agrees with K0 on the winning hypothesis, suggesting this conclusion is robust across paradigms despite K1's different perspective.

---

### K2: Precautionary

**Bias Type:** Not specified  
**Winning Hypothesis:** H0 (posterior: 0.1667) ✓ Agrees with K0

**Comparison with K0:**

| Hypothesis | K2 (Precautionary) Posterior | K0 (Scientific Consensus) Posterior | Δ (difference) |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| H0 (OTHER - Unforeseen explanation) | 0.1667 | 0.1667 | 0.0000 |
| H1 (TRUE - Vaccines directly ca...) | 0.1667 | 0.1667 | 0.0000 |
| H2 (FALSE - No causal link exists) | 0.1667 | 0.1667 | 0.0000 |
| H3 (PARTIAL - Rare subgroup vul...) | 0.1667 | 0.1667 | 0.0000 |
| H4 (PARTIAL - Indirect pathway ...) | 0.1667 | 0.1667 | 0.0000 |
| H5 (PARTIAL - Timing/schedule e...) | 0.1667 | 0.1667 | 0.0000 |

**Interpretation:** K2 agrees with K0 on the winning hypothesis, suggesting this conclusion is robust across paradigms despite K2's different perspective.

Discussion:
1. Robustness: All three paradigms converge on H0 as the “winning” hypothesis under equal evidence—this uniformity indicates that in the absence of distinguishing data, no paradigm can claim a unique advantage. No hypothesis is paradigm-dependent since evidence provides no differential support.
2. Bias Effects: Although K1 and K2 start with different priors, the lack of evidence (LR = 1) nullifies their biases, revealing a blind spot: without empirical data, skepticism or precaution cannot drive conclusions. Real-world biased paradigms might overinterpret anecdotal signals, but here forcing functions expose that no signal exists.
3. K0 Advantage: The privileged paradigm’s systematic use of multiple forcing functions (ontological scan, ancestral check, paradigm inversion) ensures that even with no clusters, the analysis remains transparent, pluralistic and free of hidden weighting. K0’s neutrality offers the most reliable baseline against which biases can be measured.

---

## 7. Sensitivity Analysis

With ±20% variation in K0 priors (before normalization):

- Because posteriors ∝ priors (no evidence), any increase in a hypothesis’s prior directly raises its posterior by the same factor, and vice versa.
- Conclusions are unstable: the “winning” hypothesis under K0 shifts to whichever hypothesis’s prior is inflated by 20%.
- Hypotheses with the largest absolute prior weight (e.g., H2 at 0.6 ± 20%) are most sensitive, dominating posterior mass when boosted, and vulnerable to down-weighting when reduced.

---

## 8. Conclusions

**Primary Finding:** In the absence of any evidence clusters, all six hypotheses about vaccines and autism remain equally plausible under Bayesian updating.  
**Verdict:** INDETERMINATE  
**Confidence Level:** Low, due to uniform posteriors and lack of discriminating data (WoE = 0 for all).  
**Key Uncertainties:**
- No empirical LR/WoE computed from studies or observations.
- Potential subgroup or timing effects remain untested.
- Risk of unexamined confounders (OTHER hypothesis).  
**Recommendations:**
- Assemble and include epidemiological, immunological, and genetic studies to generate non-unit likelihood ratios.
- Apply ontological scans to identify missing causal pathways.
- Conduct a paradigm inversion audit to test alternative data interpretations.
- Re-run the BFIH pipeline once substantive evidence clusters (e.g., cohort studies, randomized trials) are available.
